# AICamera_public
AI camepa on python

The application requires a camera to work!!!

This is my first python app and my first experience with mediapipe.
Bring your hand close to the camera and use your hand to control the mouse cursor, bring your thumb to the beginning of your index finger to click on the mouse.

Warnings: 
Camera is required for the app to work!!!
Your computer may get very hot when running the application !!!

This is public version "AICamera" project.
